/*Writer is pretty straight forward. Acquire a write lock so that another writers can't enter it.
Readers are little tricky. How to make sure that if one writer is inside, reader should not enter.
Straight forward right? Just look for wrt lock and if it acquired do not read.
But this creates another issue where more than one readers wants to go inside.

So solution is that let the first reader look of write lock and if it enters to read, subsequent reader should not look for write lock then becuase 
they know R0 has acquired the lock. So logic should be if reader count == 1 then acquire the lock else do not. But now assume two readers threads
are running and they want into reader function and now they both do rdr++ and if (rdr_count == 1) it will mess up. So another lock to make sure 
that once previous reader has done reader count maintainace it can signal another reader to enter*/
